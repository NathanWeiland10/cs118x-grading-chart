## Overview

The purpose of this project is to showcase the grade distribution and statistics of student project submissions for
intro-level CS classes at Wright State University. This project was created to practice using Angular while working as a
full stack developer intern at Winsupply during the Summer of 2023. [PrimeNG](https://primeng.org/) is primarily used
for styling, [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to display the chart,
and [NG Particles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-particles) for the landing page.
